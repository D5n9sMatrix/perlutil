 Scalar- Level Specifications
 The starting point is the familiar triply nested loop algorithm:
 Algorithm 1 . 1 . 5 (ijk Matrix Multiplication) If A E 1Rm x r , B E 1R'"x n , and C E
 are given, then this algorithm overwrites C with C + AB.
 for i = l :m
 for j = l :n
 for k = l :r
 C(i, j) = C(i, j) + A(i, k) · B(k, j)
 end
 end
 end
 1Rm x n1.1 .
 Basic Algorithms and Notation

 This computation involves O ( mn r) arithmetic. If the dimensions are doubled, then
 work increases by a factor of 8.
 Each loop index in Algorithm 1 . 1.5 has a particular role. ( The subscript i names
 the row, j names the column, and k handles the dot product. ) Nevertheless, the
 ordering of the loops is arbitrary. Here is the ( mathematically equivalent ) jki variant:
 for j = l :n
 for k = l:r
 for i = l :m
 C ( i, j) = C ( i, j) + A ( i, k)B ( k, j)
 end
 end
 end
 Altogether, there are six ( = 3! ) possibilities:
 ijk, jik,
 ikj, jki,
 kij,
 kji.
 Each features an inner loop operation ( dot product or sappy ) and each has its own
 pattern of data flow. For example, in the ijk variant , the inner loop oversees a dot
 product that requires access to a row of A and a column of B. The jki variant involves
 a sappy that requires access to a column of C and a column of A. These attributes are
 summarized in Table 1 . 1 . 1 together with an interpretation of what is going on when

 Table 1 . 1 . 1 . Matrix multiplication: loop orderings and properties
 the middle and inner loops are considered together. Each variant involves the same
 amount of arithmetic, but accesses the A, B, and C data differently. The ramifications
 of this are discussed in §1 .5.
